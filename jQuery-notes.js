// Lesson 1 and 2

jQuery is not a programming language, it is a library for Java Script
jQuery allows for work between js and the DOM to be much easier, as well as working with events and animations

jQuery also helps a lot by chaining methods/effects etc to elements in one line using periods in between. jQuery also has tons of pluggings as well
